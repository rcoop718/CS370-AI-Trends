# CS370-AI-Trends

In this project, I was provided with the complete codebase except for the qtrain function, which I had to implement myself. This function was pivotal for the core functionality of this application, involving sophisticated algorithmic work that integrates with the existing system seamlessly. The development process not only honed my technical skills but also gave me a focused insight into problem-solving within a well-defined scope, mirroring real-world software development practices.

Through this course, I deepened my understanding of what it means to be a computer scientist. Computer scientists tackle complex problems using computational methods and systems, which is vital for technological and societal progress. My approach to problems now mirrors the systematic, analytical mindset typical of the field: understanding the problem in depth, designing algorithmic solutions, implementing these efficiently, and iterating based on rigorous testing. Ethically, I strive to ensure that my work is not only effective but also responsible, prioritizing user privacy, data security, and making technology accessible and equitable for all users, reflecting the broader responsibilities that are needed in the tech industry.
